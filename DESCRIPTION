Title: Gene set analysis following differential expression using linear (mixed) modeling with dream
Version: 0.99.3

Author: Gabriel E. Hoffman
Maintainer: Gabriel E. Hoffman <gabriel.hoffman@mssm.edu>
Description: Perform gene set analysis on the result of differential expression using linear (mixed) modeling with dream by considering the correlation between gene expression traits.  This package is a slight modification of limma::camera to 1) be compatible with dream, and 2) allow identification of gene sets with log fold changes with mixed sign.
